NAME
    Data::Dmp - Dump Perl data structures

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of Data::Dmp (from Perl
    distribution Data-Dmp), released on 2014-12-28.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dmp; # exports dd() and dmp()
     dd [1, 2, 3];

DESCRIPTION
    This module, Data::Dmp, is inspired by Data::Dump and is my personal
    experiment. I want some of Data::Dump's features which I currently need
    and don't need the others that I currently do not need. I also want a
    smaller code base so I can easily modify (or subclass) it for custom
    dumping requirements.

    Compared to "Data::Dump", "Data::Dmp" is also pure-Perl, dumps Perl data
    structure as runnable Perl code, supports circular/blessed references.
    Unlike "Data::Dump", "Data::Dmp" does not identify tied data, does not
    support globs, does not support filtering, and mostly does not bother to
    align hash keys, identify ranges/repetition pattern. This makes the code
    simpler.

    I originally created "Data::Dmp" when wanting to write Data::Dmp::Org.
    At first I tried to modify "Data::Dump", but then got distracted by the
    extra bits that I don't need.

FUNCTIONS
  dd($data, ...) => $data ...
    Exported by default. Like "Data::Dump"'s "dd" (a.k.a. "dump"), print one
    or more data to STDOUT. Unlike "Data::Dump"'s "dd", it *always* prints
    and return *the original data* (like XXX), making it convenient to
    insert into expressions. This also removes ambiguity and saves one
    "wantarray()" call.

  dmp($data, ...) => $str
    Exported by default. Return dump result as string. Unlike "Data::Dump"'s
    "dd" (a.k.a. "dump"), it *never* prints and only return the data.

SEE ALSO
    Data::Dump and other variations/derivate works in Data::Dump::*.

    Data::Dumper and its variants.

    Data::Printer.

    YAML, JSON, Storable, Sereal, and other serialization formats.
